- 👋 Hi, I’m @antonio-castellon
- 👀 I’m interested in Software Development, History and Philosophy
- 🌱 I’m constantly learning new stuff on Computer Science, renovate or die.
- 💞️ I’m looking to have fun on my projects, that's why I'm interested in crazy projects that doesn't repeat whatever others already done on the world ;)
- 📫 Send me an email in case that you need some new fresh view on your projects.

I have few projects on github because the majority of my projects are internal from my clients or the IP rights are not on my hands ;)
